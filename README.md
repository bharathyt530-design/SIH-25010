## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Smart Crop Advisory System that uses AI, IoT, and multilingual support to empower small and marginal farmers.

- Personalized crop advisory based on soil, crop history, and climate.
- AI-powered pest/disease detection via image uploads.
- Multilingual mobile app with voice support for low-literate farmers.
- Real-time weather and market price alerts.
- Feedback-based learning for continuous improvement.

Innovation: 
This combines AI image recognition, IoT soil sensors, and real-time weather APIs in a farmer-friendly app with regional language voice support.


## Technical Approach
- Technologies Used:
  - Python, TensorFlow for AI/ML pest detection.
  - Flutter/React Native for mobile app.
  - Node.js/Django for backend.
  - PostgreSQL/MongoDB for database.
  - IoT soil sensors (pH, moisture).
  - OpenWeather API and government agri databases.

- Implementation Process:
  1. Collect soil, crop, and weather data.
  2. Run AI models for crop advisory.
  3. Deliver insights via mobile app/chatbot.
  4. Farmers upload crop images → AI detects pest/disease.
  5. Provide fertilizer/water schedule and market updates.
  6. Collect farmer feedback for improving accuracy.


## Feasibility and Viability
- Feasibility:
- Rural India has high smartphone usage; low-cost IoT sensors can be deployed via cooperatives.
- Challenges:
  - Low digital literacy among farmers.
  - Internet connectivity in rural areas.
  - Farmer trust in AI advisories.
- Strategies:
  - Provide voice-based app in local language.
  - Offline mode with SMS/IVR support.
  - Build trust via government & NGO partnerships.

## Impact and Benefits
- Social:
-  Farmers get scientific, reliable advice in their language.  
- Economic:
- Reduces fertilizer/pesticide costs, improves yield & profits.  
- Environmental:
- Encourages sustainable farming and reduced chemical overuse.  
- Scalability:
-  Can be expanded to multiple regions and crop types.
